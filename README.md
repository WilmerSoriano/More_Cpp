# C++ Projects Repository

Welcome to my C++ Projects Repository! This collection showcases a variety of C++ programs and implementations demonstrating key concepts in modern C++ development, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), templates, the Standard Template Library (STL), and more.

## üöÄ Overview

* **OOP Examples**
  Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and design patterns.
* **Template & Generic Programming**
  Function and class templates, type traits, and SFINAE.
* **STL & Algorithms**
  Containers, iterators, algorithms, and functors.
* **Concurrency & Modern Features**
  Smart pointers, move semantics, threading, and lambda expressions.
* **Utility & Demonstrations**
  Small utilities and projects that tie concepts together.

## üìã Prerequisites

* **C++ Compiler**
  A compiler supporting C++17 or later (e.g., `g++`, `clang++`).
* **Make**
  GNU Make or compatible build tool.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build & Run

All projects are organized under the `projects/` directory. Each subdirectory contains its own `Makefile`.

1. **Navigate to a Project**

   ```bash
   cd projects/<project-name>
   ```

2. **Build**

   ```bash
   make
   ```

   Compiles sources and produces an executable (typically named after the project).

3. **Run**

   ```bash
   ./<executable>
   ```

   For example:

   ```bash
   ./vector_demo
   ```

4. **Clean**

   ```bash
   make clean
   ```

   Removes compiled binaries and object files.
